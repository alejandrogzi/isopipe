//! Core module for detecting open reading frames in a query set of reads
//! Alejandro Gonzales-Irribarren, 2025
//!
//! This module contains the main functions for finding open reading frames (ORFs)
//! in a set of aligned reads.
//!
//! In short, every possible open reading frame (ORF) is detected for every
//! read in the query set. For every potential ORF, learning models and databases
//! are used to determine whether the ORF is a true ORF, a false positive.
//! All the data from each reliable ORF is collected and subjected to another
//! learning model trained with true ORFs and false positives. The process is
//! heavily parallelized to offer fast performance on large datasets.

use crate::cli::MergeArgs;

pub fn merge(_: MergeArgs) {
    // let tai = load_tai(args.tai);
    // let blast = load_blast(args.blast);
    // let toga = load_toga(args.toga);
}

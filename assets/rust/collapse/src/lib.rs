//! Core module for collapsing BED files with deduplication and indexing
//! Alejandro Gonzales-Irribarren, 2025
//!
//! This module contains the main functions for efficiently collapsing BED files
//! by identifying and deduplicating identical genomic intervals. The module provides
//! flexible output modes including collapsed BED files with queue annotations or
//! separate binary index files for space-efficient storage, extending the original
//! BED file with additional columns for read name and queue information and fast
//! lookups fo read names.
//!
//! In short, every BED entry is fingerprinted using byte-level hashing accounting
//! for specific columns from the original BED file to ensure that only truly identical
//! rows are grouped together. The deduplicated entries are held in memory alongside
//! their corresponding read identifier queues [maintaining original order for reconstruction].
